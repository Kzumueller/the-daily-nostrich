# The Daily Nostrich

Nostr client in the style of an old-timey newspaper, 
focused on original posts, images, and videos.  
Interactive elements are mostly kept outside the paper itself and facilitated by speech bubbles.

Supports creating new identities/accounts and uses a follow pack for instant reading material. 

## Setup

```bash
  npm install
  yarn install
